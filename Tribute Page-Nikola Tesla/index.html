          <li>
            <strong>1900</strong> - Returned to New York and began working on his Wardenclyffe Tower project, aiming to establish 
            wireless communication and transmit power wirelessly
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1905</strong> - The Wardenclyffe Tower project faced financial difficulties and was eventually abandoned
